# B2B Professional Networking Example

This example demonstrates how Tacit can replace cold outreach with agent-negotiated, pre-qualified business introductions.

## Scenario

**Alice** is a startup founder building payments infrastructure. She needs enterprise customers.

**Bob** works at a bank's innovation team. He's actively evaluating payment infrastructure vendors.

Their Tacit agents discover each other, verify mutual fit, and broker an introduction — without either person writing a cold email.

## Run

```bash
npx tsx examples/b2b-networking/demo.ts
```

## What This Demonstrates

1. **Intent-based discovery** — Agents publish what they're seeking, not who they are
2. **Authenticity verification** — Both agents check each other's trust scores
3. **Automated matching** — The scoring engine evaluates compatibility across multiple dimensions
4. **Double opt-in** — Both humans must approve before any introduction happens
5. **Progressive reveal** — Identity is shared in stages, not all at once

## Why B2B First

- Every qualified meeting has measurable dollar value ($100-$10,000+)
- Enterprises are already deploying AI agents (78% of Fortune 500 by end 2026)
- LinkedIn's engagement-optimized algorithm creates noise, not signal
- The "my sales agent talked to their procurement agent" demo is immediately compelling
